<h2 id="label-Pull+Requests">Pull Requests<span><a href="#label-Pull+Requests">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Contributions to RubyGems are made via GitHub pull requests, which must be
approved by a project committer other than the author. To approve a PR, a
maintainer can leave a comment including the text “@homu r+”, indicating
that they have reviewed the PR and approve it. [Homu](<a
href="http://homu.io">homu.io</a>) will then automatically create a merge
commit, test the merge, and land the PR if the merge commit passes the
tests.</p>

<p>This process guarantees that our release branches always have passing
tests, and reduces siloing of information to a single contributor. For a
full list of possible commands, see [the Homu documentation](<a
href="http://homu.io">homu.io</a>).</p>

<h2 id="label-Long-Term+Support">Long-Term Support<span><a href="#label-Long-Term+Support">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>RubyGems long-term support policy will be similar to and follow the Ruby
long-term support policy.</p>

<p>When a Ruby version reaches end-of-life, the RubyGems version included in
that release will also reach end-of-life.  After that date no security
releases will be made for RubyGems releases up to the version shipped in
the next release of Ruby.</p>

<p>For example, Ruby 1.9.3 reached end-of-life on 23 February 2015.  RubyGems
version 2.0.0 shipped with Ruby 2.0.0, so no RubyGems versions earlier than
2.0.0 will receive any updates.  Ruby 2.1.0 shipped with RubyGems 2.2.0. 
When Ruby 2.0.0 reaches end-of-life no RubyGems versions earlier than 2.2.0
will receive any updates.</p>

<h3 id="label-Security+Fixes">Security Fixes<span><a href="#label-Security+Fixes">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Security releases will be made for RubyGems version series that were
included in a Ruby release.</p>

<p>For example, RubyGems 2.0.x will recieve security fixes until Ruby 2.0.0
reaches end-of-life.</p>

<h2 id="label-Release+Policies">Release Policies<span><a href="#label-Release+Policies">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>RubyGems primarily makes bug fix releases off of the master branch.  We may
mix bug fixes and new features in the same release.  RubyGems does not
guarantee it will make bug fix releases for earlier versions.</p>

<p>For example, RubyGems 2.5.0 was recently released.  RubyGems does not
guarantee any non-security bugfix releases will be made upon the 2.4.x
series, or any earlier series, of releases.</p>

<p>Additionally, when a Ruby version reaches end-of-life the following release
of RubyGems will no longer be required to maintain backwards compatibility
with that Ruby version.  This may result in a major version change.</p>

<p>For example, since Ruby 1.9.3 has reached end-of-life, RubyGems may use
features of ruby that only exist in Ruby 2.0 and later.  As of this writing
RubyGems is 2.5.x, so the RubyGems version would become 3.x if it used
features only available in Ruby 2.0 and later.</p>

<h2 id="label-Committer+Access">Committer Access<span><a href="#label-Committer+Access">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>RubyGems committers may lose their commit privileges if they are inactive
for longer than 12 months.  Committer permission may be restored upon
request by having a pull request merged.</p>

<p>This is designed to improve the maintainability of RubyGems by requiring
committers to maintain familiarity with RubyGems activity and to improve
the security of RubyGems by preventing idle committers from having their
commit permissions compromised or exposed.</p>

<h2 id="label-Changing+These+Policies">Changing These Policies<span><a href="#label-Changing+These+Policies">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>These policies were set in order to reduce the burden of maintenance and to
keep committers current with existing development and policies.  RubyGems
work is primarily volunteer-driven which limits the ability to provide
long-term support.  By funding RubyTogether you can help extend support for
older RubyGems versions.</p>
